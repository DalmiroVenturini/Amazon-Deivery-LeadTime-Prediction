# Amazon Deivery LeadTime Prediction

# Project Overview
This project tackles the issue of late deliveries faced by Amazon in the United States and Puerto Rico. Customers often experience dissatisfaction when orders do not arrive on time, affecting trust and loyalty.

By leveraging machine learning models, we aim to accurately predict delivery lead times and provide actionable insights to reduce customer complaints and improve operational efficiency.

# Problem Statement
Customers expect timely delivery of their orders. When delays occur, it can negatively impact their experience and Amazon's reputation. This project focuses on:
  -  Analyzing historical sales and delivery data.
  -  Identifying key drivers of delivery times.
  -  Developing a predictive model to estimate delivery lead times.

# Dataset Description
The dataset provided by Amazon contains sales records from 2015 to 2017 for the United States and Puerto Rico.

Key Information:
  -  Total Rows: 185,500
  -  Columns: 53
  -  Products Analyzed: 118 unique products
  -  Timeframe: 2015â€“2017

Key Features Used:
  -  Customer Information: Country, segment, etc.
  -  Product Details: Price, category, etc.
  -  Shipping Details: Mode, year, month, weekday, lead time, etc.
  -  Sales Data: Profit, delivery status, etc.

# Assumptions:
  -  Each row, entry represents a customer order.
  -  Each customer order is associated to one unit product sale.

After initial analysis, the focus was narrowed down to the Top 10 products generating the highest profit, with further modeling applied to the most profitable product: Field & Stream Sportsman 16 Gun Fire Safe.

# Analysis and Approach
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
  -  Focused on Top 10 profitable products.

Key Insights:
  -  90% of the profit is generated by only 8.5% of the products.
  -  Delivery times are significantly influenced by shipping modes.
